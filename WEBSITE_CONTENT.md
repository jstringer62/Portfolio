### The Story (First Person, Direct)

Five years in L&D. Government, healthcare, SaaS. I've seen the same problems everywhere.

Content requests pile up faster than you can build. Nobody can prove training actually works. The LMS is a graveyard. Onboarding takes forever and people still don't know what they're doing.

I fix these things. By working closely with stakeholders, not dropping shiny tools and disappearing.

At Pearl Interactive Network, I ran L&D for a 1,000+ person org with a lean team. The math didn't work with traditional methods. So I built AI-powered content pipelines instead. Research, drafts, assessments, images. AI handled the repetitive stuff. My team handled what matters: strategy, quality, stakeholder alignment.

Production time dropped 75%. We got ahead of the backlog instead of drowning in it.

But here's the thing. The AI is just the accelerant. What makes it work is knowing what good training looks like. I've redesigned onboarding that cut ramp time 30%. Built compliance programs that pass audits. Scaled LMS operations from zero to 500+ learners.

AI makes me faster. Experience makes me effective.

### What I Bring (4 Capability Cards)

**Card 1: AI-Enabled Learning Systems**
I don't just use AI tools. I design interconnected workflows where LLMs, image generation, and automation work together as a system. Content pipelines, assessment generation, feedback analysis. If it can't be explained to stakeholders or supported by the team, it doesn't ship.

**Card 2: LMS Implementation & Optimization**
Deep hands-on experience with TalentLMS, 360Learning, and Paycom. From vendor evaluation to rollout to optimization. I've scaled learning operations to 500+ learners with trackable delivery and performance analytics.

**Card 3: Instructional Design That Works**
ADDIE, SAM, Agile. I've used them all, but I care more about results than methodology. Interactive e-learning in Articulate 360. Blended programs for virtual and in-person. Content that actually changes behavior.

**Card 4: Data-Driven Training Strategy**
I design training programs that can prove their value. Baseline metrics before launch. Business-aligned KPIs. ROI calculations that executives understand. Not just completions. Impact.

## HOW I WORK PAGE (Optional but Recommended)

### Header

**Title:** How I Work

**Subtext:** Not a methodology deck. Just how I actually operate.

---

### How I Diagnose Problems

I don't start with solutions. I start with questions.

- What's the actual business problem? (Not the training request. The problem.)
- What's been tried before? Why didn't it work?
- Who are the real stakeholders? Who has veto power?
- What does success look like in numbers, not feelings?

Most training fails because someone skipped this part.

---

### How I Decide When AI Is Appropriate

AI isn't always the answer. I use it when:

- The task is repetitive and high-volume (content drafts, assessment variations)
- Quality can be verified before it ships
- The team can maintain it without me
- It actually saves time vs. doing it manually

I don't use it when:

- It's a novelty play with no real ROI
- Stakeholders won't understand or trust it
- It creates dependencies nobody can support

---

### How I Measure Success

Before anything gets built, I define:

- The baseline (where are we now?)
- The target metric (what should change?)
- The timeline (when do we check?)

If we can't measure it, we don't build it. Completions aren't success. Behavior change is.

---

### What I Don't Do

- Hype. I don't chase trends or sell vaporware.
- Vanity metrics. "100% completion rate" means nothing if performance didn't change.
- Drop and disappear. I build things that teams can actually maintain.
- Overcomplicate. Simple systems that work beat complex systems that don't.

## COPY NOTES & DECISIONS

### Tone Guidelines (From Personality File)
- Direct, conversational, clipped
- Short sentences. Fragments are fine.
- Slightly rough edges > perfectly polished
- Competence over flash
- No corporate fluff, no fake enthusiasm

### Key Messages to Reinforce
1. I diagnose problems before building solutions
2. AI is a tool, not a gimmick. Experience makes it work.
3. Results are measurable (30%, 75%, 500+)
4. I've seen the same problems everywhere. I know how to fix them.

### Words to Use
- Fix, build, diagnose
- Works, broken, actually
- Lean, real, practical

### Words to Avoid
- Revolutionary, cutting-edge, game-changing
- Passionate, excited, thrilled
- Guru, ninja, rockstar
- Synergy, leverage, empower
- "I'm passionate about..." (everyone says this)
- Anything that sounds like HR wrote it

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Review this content draft** - Does the tone feel right? Any sections to cut/expand?
